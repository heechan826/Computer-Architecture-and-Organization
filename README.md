## Problem 1 
- Calculate either of sum, max or min of the list depending on keyboard input.
- 's’ -> Print out the sum with a proper message (like "The sum is 232") 
- 'x’ -> Print out the max
- 'n’ -> Print out the min
- 'q’ -> Quit the loop. 

## Problem 2
- Calculate y = max(0, A*X + B)
- A is a m x n matrix,
- X, B are vectors with floating point numbers (single precision)
